# - SeaWulf-1. Server dispatcher (required) *AFTER MEETING PROF*

Establish a protected directory on the SeaWulf to store your team’s data. Pre-stage any data
that might be used repeatedly for SeaWulf runs. Prior to submitting a batch districting run
request to the SeaWulf, the data required for the run should be marshalled (from memory
and/or DB), and passed to the SeaWulf as a file (or multiple files) to be stored in the team’s
SeaWulf file system.

# SeaWulf-2. Run MGGG Recom algorithm on the SeaWulf (required) (AD) *BY END OF WEEK*

Set the constants in the MGGG code to define the properties (e.g., constraints) of the run. Any run-control 
information should be packaged in a SeaWulf acceptable format (e.g., script commands) and executed on 
the SeaWulf. Your activity diagram should demonstrate that you understand how the MGGG algorithm operates.

# SeaWulf-5. Calculate the number of majority-minority districts in a random districting (preferred) (AD) DONE
For each of the minority groups of interest for your states, calculate the number of districts in a
districting with a minority population percentage in excess of a predetermined threshold. Note:
you set the threshold, but in most cases, this should be 50%. This calculation should be done for
any population categories you are implementing in your system (total population, voting age
population (VAP), and citizen voting age population (CVAP)).

# SeaWulf-7. Calculate Republican/Democratic splits for each random district plan (required) (AD) Need to add saving
For each generated plan, estimate the Republican/Democratic votes in each district. Since each
district is a collection of precincts, use the historic precinct vote totals (e.g., 2020 Presidential)
to estimate the winner of a Congressional election in each district.

# SeaWulf-8. Calculate the seat/vote split curve for each random districting (required) (AD) READ UP ON IT SHOULD BE EASY TOMORROW
Using a modified Gelman/King approach, calculate data for the seat/vote curve.

# SeaWulf-9. Generate summary data from individual seat/vote district plan data (required) (AD)  *ASK GROUP*

# SeaWulf-10. Generate Republican/Democratic seat splits data (required) (AD) TODAY
WILL USE SEAWULF USE CASE 7

# SeaWulf-11. Generate Majority-Minority district summary data (required) (AD) DONE

# SeaWulf-14. Calculate box & whisker data (required) (AD) DONE
Calculate the box & whisker summary data for all the random district plans generated by the
SeaWulf. These calculations will be for Republican population share, Democratic population
share, and minority population percentage for any minority population that might require at
least one majority-minority district in any of the team’s states.
